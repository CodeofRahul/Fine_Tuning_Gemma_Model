# Gemma-2B Fine-tuned for Summarization using QLoRA

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Gemma-2B language model for conversation summarization using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) on the SAMSum dataset. It leverages Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT, and BitsAndBytes libraries for efficient and effective fine-tuning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model capable of generating concise and accurate summaries of conversations. We achieve this by fine-tuning a pre-trained Gemma-2B model using QLoRA, a technique that reduces memory footprint and speeds up training while maintaining performance. The SAMSum dataset, consisting of dialogues and their corresponding summaries, is used for training and evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Fine-tuning Gemma-2B:** Leverages the powerful Gemma-2B language model as the foundation.
- **QLoRA for Efficiency:** Employs Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation for memory-efficient fine-tuning.
- **SAMSum Dataset:** Utilizes a well-established dataset for conversation summarization.
- **Hugging Face Ecosystem:** Integrates seamlessly with Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT, and Datasets libraries.
- **Detailed Code:** Provides clear and well-commented code for easy understanding and reproducibility.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Install dependencies:**
3. **Authenticate with Hugging Face Hub:**

4. **Run the Colab notebook:**
   Open the notebook in Google Colab and execute the cells. This will download the dataset, fine-tune the model, and save the results.

## Usage

After fine-tuning, you can use the model to generate summaries of conversations:
